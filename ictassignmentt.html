<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family:Times New Roman; color:#ff9966;"> <strong> Let's dig deeper in the ocean of never-ending festivals of India </strong> </h2>
<br> <br>
<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;"> Let's start with........<b> DIWALI</b> <br>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;"> <i> Diwali is the festival lights lightening and demolishing the darkness of everyone. It is the festival where we see joy and happiness in everyone. </i> How wonderful the sight is when we see children playing and enjoying with their friends and bursting <del>crackers</del> <ins> green crackers! </ins> It is the festival where we celebrate the victory of good over evil, and welcome <em>Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita </em> after they defeat the mighty demon king: <em> RAVANA. </em> In this festival, we renovate and clean our houses, exchange sweets with our family and friends, we light lamps and lanterns, and children burst <sup> green crackers. </sup> </p>
<br> <br>
<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;">Next Festival is........<b> Eid al-Fitr</b> <br>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;"> <b>
Eid al-Fitr, (<em>Arabic: “Festival of Breaking Fast” </em>) also spelled ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, also called al-ʿĪd al-Ṣaghīr, Turkish Ramazan Bayrami (“Ramadan Festival”) </b>, first of two canonical festivals of Islam. <i>Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, and is celebrated during the first three days of Shawwal </i>, the 10th month of the Islamic calendar (though the Muslim use of a lunar calendar means that it may fall in any season of the year). As in Islam’s other holy festival, Eid al-Adha, it is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer (ṣalāt) at daybreak on its first day. Eid al-Fitr is a time of official receptions and private visits, when friends greet one another, presents are given, new clothes are worn, and the graves of relatives are visited. </p>
<br> <br>
<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;">Let's move on with.......<b>  Guru Nanak Gurupurab </b> <br>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;">
<b>Guru Nanak Jayanti, also known as Gurpurab </b>, is the most <strong> important festival for the followers of the religion of Sikhism. It is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev. </strong> The festival is celebrated on the day of Kartik Poornima, which is the <i>fifteenth lunar day in the month of Kartik according to the Hindu calendar</i>, and usually falls in the month of November by the Gregorian calendar. </p>
<br> <br>
<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;">Last but not the least.......<b>   Christmas </b> <br>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:Cursive; color:#ff66cc;">
<b>Christmas, Christian festival celebrating the birth of Jesus</b>. <em>The English term Christmas (“mass on Christ’s day”) is of fairly recent origin. </em>The earlier term Yule may have derived from the Germanic jōl or the Anglo-Saxon geōl, which referred to the feast of the winter solstice. The corresponding terms in other languages—Navidad in Spanish, Natale in Italian, Noël in French—all probably denote nativity. <i>The German word Weihnachten denotes “hallowed night.”</i> Since the early 20th century, Christmas has also been a secular family holiday, observed by Christians and non-Christians alike, devoid of Christian elements, and marked by an increasingly elaborate exchange of gifts. In this secular Christmas celebration, a mythical figure named Santa Claus plays the pivotal role. This year, Christmas is celebrated on Sunday, December 25, 2022. </p>
